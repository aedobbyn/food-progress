# ------ next up
# for each nutriet in <array of nutrients>, check whether we've met the required amount. if so, move on to the next
  # if not, either
    # a) adjust serving sizes of current foods (Gm_Wt1) until we've met the requirements
        # increase the serving size of a food that is high in that nutrient. find out how many calories we incrased by when we made this adjustment
        # correspondingly decrease the serving size of all other foods such that the calorie count stays the same after
          # we make thse adjustments
    # b) swap in food that is > 1 std_dev above the mean on the nutrient we're lacking for a food on our current menu that
        # is low in that nutrient
