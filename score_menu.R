# 1) on positive nutrients, you can't get a better score than 0
# 2) on must_restricts, a positive score means you're below the daily maximum on some must_restricts, which is good. 
    # a negative score means you're above the maximum on some must_restricts, which is bad.
# 3) the overall score adds these two together


# -------------------- Positive Nutrients ----------------
# no extra credit for going above the daily min. best score is 0, worst score is negative infinity.
# max score is 0, min score is -infinity

# a positive score on any nutrient would mean you're above the min daily amount. no extra brownie points for that,
    # so we give you a 0
# a negative score on any nutrient means you're below the min daily amount
